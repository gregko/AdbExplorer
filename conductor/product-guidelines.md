# AdbExplorer Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
- **Concise and Technical:** User-facing text and documentation should prioritize speed and precision, using clear technical language suitable for an audience of developers and power users.

## Brand Messaging & Tone
- **Efficient and Powerful:** AdbExplorer should be positioned as a productivity-enhancing tool that simplifies complex ADB workflows, emphasizing speed, reliability, and technical capability.

## Visual Design Principles
- **Minimalist:** The UI should be clean and uncluttered, prioritizing content and functional elements. Unnecessary visual noise should be removed to ensure a focused and efficient user experience.

## Notifications & Error Handling
- **Non-intrusive Status Bar Notifications:** Use the status bar for providing feedback on operations. Employ color-coding (e.g., blue for success, red for errors) to convey status at a glance without interrupting the user's flow.

## UI Interactions
- **Keyboard-First Design:** All primary functions must be accessible via keyboard shortcuts to cater to power users and ensure maximum efficiency.
- **Mouse/Touch Friendly:** Despite the keyboard focus, the interface should maintain large, accessible targets and intuitive interactions for mouse and touch users.
